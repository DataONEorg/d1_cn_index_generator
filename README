DataONE CN Index Task Generator Lib
------------------------

This component provides index task generation for later consumption by index processor which will
generate solr index update requests based on index tasks found in index task datastore (placed there
by the index generator).  The index task items are generated based on updates to the CN stack's
hazelcast systemMetadata map.  This component creates an entry listener on this map to trigger
task creation.

This project is a consummer of the IndexTask repository provided by cn_index_common component.  
The generator's spring configuration (generator-context.xml) imports the index-task-context.xml to
provide repository access.

The production configuration context file (generator-daemon-context.xml) adds production references to
external configuration including the jdbc.properties.

See the test classes under src/test for example usage and test-context.xml for test runtime configuration.

See LICENSE.txt for the details of distributing this software.
